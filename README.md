# Tephra

Some small utils for playing with the BlueSky API using Mojo.
For anything serious, I would recommend some of the more robust libraries, such as the Go library [Indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo).

## Usage
`magic run firehose` will start displaying a stream of the firehose.

## References
I read and adapted from a ton of different projects to get this working.
